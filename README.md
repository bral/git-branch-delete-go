# 2. Prune remote branches
git-branch-delete prune --remote

# 3. Delete merged feature branches
git-branch-delete interactive --merged
```

#### Batch Delete Feature Branches

```bash
# 1. List all feature branches
git-branch-delete list --filter="feature/*"

# 2. Delete all merged feature branches
git-branch-delete delete --pattern="feature/*" --merged

# 3. Verify deletion
git-branch-delete list --all
```

#### Safe Remote Cleanup

```bash
# 1. Show what would be deleted
